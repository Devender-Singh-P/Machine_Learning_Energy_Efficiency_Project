### POC
This project is a POC for similar project done during the Internship period at iNeuron Intelligence Pvt. Ltd.
The original project was done for a MNC client where various tech stacks were used from ETL pipelines for data accessing to development of the project through rigorous hardwork of a team having expertise in Big Data, Data Science, Development, DevOps alongwith other fields and this is just a portion of the same due to resource constraints at individual level.

Modular coding approach has been implemented and the app is deployed on Heroku.

### Problem Statement:
The effect of eight input variables (relative compactness, surface area, wall area, roof area, overall height, orientation, glazing area, glazing area distribution) on two output variables, namely heating load (HL) and cooling load (CL), of residential buildings is investigated using a statistical machine learning framework. We have to use a number of classical and non-parametric statistical analytic tools to carefully analyse the strength of each input variable's correlation with each of the output variables in order to discover the most strongly associated input variables. We need to estimate HL and CL, we can compare a traditional linear regression approach to a sophisticated state-of-the-art nonlinear non-parametric method, random forests.
